# single-file-httpd.conf
Single file httpd.conf configuration file for Apache HTTPD Server.

* Most Linux distributions if not all come with a difficult complex scheme to configure Apache HTTPD Server.
Probably this configuration schemes where thought out mostly for ISP's which host lots of different virtualhosts for many different people.

* I consider most configurations out there for tutorials can be misguiding.

* Here I just pretend to define a basic template configuration with every basic need within a single configuration file.

* The aim for this are newbies and people who work on their own projects but this can be used for much more.

* Of course everyone interested in learning how to configure apache should look at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ for explanation of section/contexts and what every directive is for and where it should go. Apache documentation is very well organized and helpful, so do not forget to give it a try.
